This project used Machine Learning to classify lung diseases 
based on a dataset from Shenzhen Hospital. 
It was completed using the Jupyter Notebook 
and TensorFlow as the library. The code is written in Python 
and can be showcased by navigating to the ipynb file above.

Example of the CT Scans used as the dataset

By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), 
models were created to properly train the data and achieve a success rate of 80%. 
The CNN's used are Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy and Binary Cross Entropy. 
The results can be seen below.
