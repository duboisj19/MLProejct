This project used Machine Learning to classify lung diseases based on a dataset from Shenzhen Hospital. 
It was completed using the Jupyter Notebook and TensorFlow as the library. The code is written in Python 
and can be showcased by navigating to the ipynb file above.

By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), models were created to properly train the data and achieve a 
success rate of 80%. The CNN's used are Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy and Binary Cross Entropy. 
The results can be seen below. Further explanation can be seen by going throug the code.
